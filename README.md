Distance Calculator Project
Overview

This project calculates the total distance between a series of geographical waypoints using their latitude and longitude coordinates. The distance is computed in kilometers using the Haversine formula.
Features

    Input a series of geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
    Calculate the distance between each pair of consecutive waypoints.
    Sum the distances to get the total travel distance.

Requirements

    C compiler (e.g., GCC)
    Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, math.h)

Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal:

bash

gcc -o distance_calculator distance_calculator.c -lm

Make sure you have the distance_calculator.c file in the same directory as your terminal.
Usage

    Run the compiled program:

bash

./distance_calculator

    Enter the number of waypoints when prompted (minimum of 2).

    Enter the latitude and longitude for each waypoint. The format for each coordinate is <latitude> <longitude>.

    The program will output the total distance in kilometers that you will travel by visiting the waypoints in the given order.

Example

kotlin

Enter the number of waypoints (minimum = 2): 3

Enter the coordinates of the waypoints as <latitude><longitude>
Waypoint 1: 40.7128 -74.0060
Waypoint 2: 34.0522 -118.2437
Waypoint 3: 51.5074 -0.1278

By taking this route you will travel 12477.39Km

Code Structure

    struct geoCoord: A structure to store latitude and longitude of a waypoint.
    DistanceKm(double lat1, double lat2, double lon1, double lon2): A function to calculate the distance between two points given their latitudes and longitudes.
    totalDistanceKm(struct geoCoord* coordinates, int numWaypoints): A function to calculate the total distance for a series of waypoints.
    main(): The main function that handles input/output and coordinates the calculation process.
